	// Header returns the header map that will be sent by
	// WriteHeader. The Header map also is the mechanism with which
	// Handlers can set HTTP trailers.
	//
	// Changing the header map after a call to WriteHeader (or
	// Write) has no effect unless the modified headers are
	// trailers.
	//
	// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
	// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
	// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
	// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
	// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
	// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
	// keys not known to the Handler until after the first Write,
	// is to prefix the Header map keys with the TrailerPrefix
	// constant value. See TrailerPrefix.
	//
	// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
	// their value to nil.
	Header() Header

	// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
	//
	// If WriteHeader has not yet been called, Write calls
	// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
	// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
	// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
	// DetectContentType. Additionally, if the total size of all written
	// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
	// Content-Length header is added automatically.
	//
	// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
	// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
	// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
	// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
	// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
	// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
	// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
	// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
	// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
	// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
	// possible to maximize compatibility.
	Write([]byte) (int, error)

	// WriteHeader sends an HTTP response header with the provided
	// status code.
	//
	// If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write
	// will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
	// Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
	// send error codes.
	//
	// The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
	// Only one header may be written. Go does not currently
	// support sending user-defined 1xx informational headers,
	// with the exception of 100-continue response header that the
	// Server sends automatically when the Request.Body is read.

	// SetDeadline sets the read and write deadlines associated
	// with the connection. It is equivalent to calling both
	// SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline.
	//
	// A deadline is an absolute time after which I/O operations
	// fail with a timeout (see type Error) instead of
	// blocking. The deadline applies to all future and pending
	// I/O, not just the immediately following call to Read or
	// Write. After a deadline has been exceeded, the connection
	// can be refreshed by setting a deadline in the future.
	//
	// An idle timeout can be implemented by repeatedly extending
	// the deadline after successful Read or Write calls.
	//
	// A zero value for t means I/O operations will not time out.
	//
	// Note that if a TCP connection has keep-alive turned on,
	// which is the default unless overridden by Dialer.KeepAlive
	// or ListenConfig.KeepAlive, then a keep-alive failure may
	// also return a timeout error. On Unix systems a keep-alive
	// failure on I/O can be detected using
	// errors.Is(err, syscall.ETIMEDOUT).

	// some of the data was successfully written.
